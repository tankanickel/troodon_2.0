# Troodon 2.0
Newest mod to klipper with built-in raspberry pi 4, BTT HDMI5 display, a Fly SB2040 v1 Canbus PCB with stealthburner toolhead (V6 bambu lab hotend) and still runnning Voron Tap

Currently still in calibration and WIP

------------------------ OLD RRF -------------------------

Here´s my current config for the printer along with my printer profiles for SuperSlicer.

The base used is the improved config by TeamGloomy(1.2 https://github.com/TeamGloomy/Troodon-V2).

I´m running a Stealthburner, CW2 and Voron Tap upgrade on my printer.
